# Color My Frame
World of Warcraft addon that changes the color of your player's unit frame to make it stand out among the other party/raid frames.

Also let's you re-color other players' frames as long as "Display Class Colors" is not enabled in Interface options.

KNOWN BUGS:
- preview frame in settings is not live updating
    - workaround: reload ui
- "Defaults" button in addon settings to reset to defaults is not working
    - workaround: delete: `\World of Warcraft\_retail_\WTF\Account\<AccountName>\SavedVariables\ColorMyFrame.lua`
